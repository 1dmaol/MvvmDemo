# Mobile Developer Technical Challenge @ Appspace

A mobile app for Android and iOS to list Marvel comics and is targeted for an AppSpace technical challenge. 
The application uses MvvmCross to share code between platforms and is based on Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS frameworks (Xamarin Classic).

## Future work

The project is completed, but being small in scale, it requires some additional implementations to address certain issues and achieve a more professional outcome.

The areas that need improvement are as follows:

- Develop a more detailed ViewModel and ViewController to enhance the overall architecture.
- Utilize Android Fragments and Navigation Stack for a robust navigation experience on the Android platform.
- Enhance the iOS frontend design by utilizing NIB Files instead of creating views through code.
- Employ IOS Segues and MvvmCross Navigation to streamline navigation on the iOS platform (Documentation: https://www.mvvmcross.com/documentation/fundamentals/navigation).

By incorporating these enhancements, the project will attain a higher level of professionalism, leading to an improved user experience.
